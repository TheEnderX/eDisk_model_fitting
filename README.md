# Modified Model and Fitting Code for ALMA Large Program eDisk

This repository contains modified and extended models and fitting codes based on the [pdspy package](https://github.com/psheehan/pdspy) by Patrick Sheehan. These modifications were developed during the research with the eDisk program at UIUC under instruction of Professor Leslie W. Looney.

## Overview
This project extends the original model fitting code functionality with:
- Availability for binary (or more) disks model fitting
- Modified asymmetric ring models
- Stacked-disks model
- Other useful models
- Printing out native model for profile analysis

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- [pdspy](https://github.com/psheehan/pdspy)
- [dynesty](https://github.com/joshspeagle/dynesty)
- Other Python Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, mpi4py
