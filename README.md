# Modified Models for Protoplanetary Disk Fitting Based on pdspy

This repository contains modified and extended models based on the [pdspy package](https://github.com/psheehan/pdspy) by Patrick Sheehan. These modifications were developed during the research with the eDisk program at UIUC.

## Overview
This project extends the original model fitting code functionality with:
- Availability for binary disk model fitting
- Modified asymmetric ring model
- Stacked-disks model implementation
- Printing out native model for profile analysis

## Dependencies
- pdspy (original package)
- Python 3
