# eDisk_model_fitting
Modified Models for Protoplanetary Disk Analysis  This repository contains enhanced modeling tools based on pdspy, specifically developed for analyzing ALMA interferometric observations of protoplanetary disks. The modifications focus on improving model fitting capabilities for complex disk structures, particularly for binary systems.
